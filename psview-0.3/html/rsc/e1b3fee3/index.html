   <p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:16pt">A League Of Their Own</span></p>
   <p style="text-align:center"></p>
   <p style="text-align:center">Eric Ellis</p>
   <p style="text-align:center"></p>
   <p>	I&#146;ve never seen anything quite like it before, but the motion picture, &ldquo;A League of their Own&rdquo; is just a great movie all around. &nbsp;It tells the story of an all girls baseball league that was formed during World War II. &nbsp;Most of the professional baseball players had stopped playing in order to go fight for their country overseas. This left a huge hole in the baseball world and they needed to fulfill it somehow. &nbsp;Their solution was to get the best softball players from around the country to come play professional baseball. &nbsp;They called it the &ldquo;All American Girls Professional Baseball League.&rdquo; &nbsp;It wasn&#146;t easy and just about didn&#146;t work initially, but it turned into a huge success.</p>
   <p>	In the reading from week 2, &ldquo;The Rise and Decline of Organized Women&#146;s Sports, 1980-1960,&rdquo; it discusses the &ldquo;All American Girls Professional Baseball League&rdquo; and lines up pretty accurately to how to the film portrayed it. &nbsp;The reading talks how they were required to wear short dresses and attend a charm school to learn how to apply makeup, fix their hair, and display proper feminine social graces. &nbsp;This is exactly what was shown in the movie. &nbsp;The women were initially opposed to the idea of having to play in short dresses but quickly accepted it once they were told to either wear them or not play. </p>
   <p style="text-indent:36.000000pt">Wearing dresses while playing sports for women was very common in the beginning of sport for women. &nbsp;Although, wearing a short dress was fairly new at the time. &nbsp;Women were supposed to wear dresses that covered up all parts of their body as to not make their sport sexual. &nbsp;</p>
   <p>	There were a few historical inaccuracies in this film such as the man who initiated the league was a candy bar mogul. &nbsp;When in fact, the owner of Wrigley Gum created it. &nbsp;They probably just didn&#146;t have permission to use his name in the movie. &nbsp;Along with that, during the tryouts they called the field some random name, where it was actually Wrigley field, home of the Chicago Cubs. &nbsp;Also, all of the characters in the movie were fictional, with only a couple that were loosely based off of real women (AAGPBL.com).</p>
   <p></p>
   <p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:16pt">The Real AAGPBL</span></p>
   <p>	In the movie, at the end of tryouts they posted the rosters for the four teams on a wall near the dugout and everyone ran over to see if they had made it. &nbsp;After reading the league history from the official website of the AAGPBL, it actually states that they found out if they made the team by telephone. &nbsp;They depict a girl looking at the list and crying, not because she was cut, but because she couldn&#146;t read. While it may have been the case that one of the players couldn&#146;t read, this event never happened in real life. </p>
   <p>	Something that wasn&#146;t discussed entirely during the film was the rules of the game. &nbsp;They made it appear that the women were playing the exact same game as the men played. &nbsp;While most of that is true, they did not play on same size fields. &nbsp;Base paths ranged from 65 feet early in the league to 85 feet in the last season. Men, on the other hand, played on base paths with a length of 90 feet. &nbsp;The pitching mound was also closer than the men&#146;s, with the exception of the last year of the league, where it was moved back to 60 feet. &nbsp;It&#146;s interesting to note that in the movie they always pitched overhand. &nbsp;But really, they pitched underhand for the first four years of the league. &nbsp;They eventually changed to overhand, but the movie took place during the first season of the league. &nbsp;</p>
   <p>	There wasn&#146;t much discussion of the women&#146;s athletic career before they were in the AAGPBL in the movie. They didn&#146;t give much insight to where these girls came from. &nbsp;An article of the AAGPBL website talks about Jean Ann and her athletic career growing up. &nbsp;She was a shortstop for the Fort Wayne Daises during the 1953 and 1954 seasons. &nbsp;When she was a child, she played football at the local playground and would tuck her pigtails into her helmet in order to do so. &nbsp;That was until an opposing team found out she was a girl and was actually banned from playing football. She was such a talented athlete she also participated in hockey, baseball, basketball, and competed as a speed skater. After her time in the AAGPBL, she went on to compete on a national level as a bowler. &nbsp;She is in the Women&#146;s International Bowling Congress Hall of Fame, as well as the only bowler in the Minnesota Sports Hall of Fame.</p>
   <p>	Many of the baseball players were just like Ann, not only very good at baseball, but excelled it other sports as well. &nbsp;The movie really just focused on the baseball aspects and never got into too much detail of their other athletic prowess. </p>
   <p></p>
   <p style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:16pt">The Readings, AAGPBL Website, and A League Of Their Own</span></p>
   <p>	One thing that was constant throughout the readings, the league website, and the motion picture for theses athletes was the need to act like a &ldquo;lady.&rdquo;	From Jennifer Hargreaves &ldquo;the Victorian cult of the family and the early years of female sport&rdquo; she states that, &ldquo;women were obliged to show restraint, be refined and respectable, and confirm at all times the &#145;ladylike&#146; modes of behavior prescribed for them.&rdquo; In the movie, as well as described from their website, the women were act proper at all times. &nbsp;Smoking was not allowed, nor was drinking. &nbsp;Some players apposed to the strict rules they had to live by and even broke them occasionally, but they adhered to them in order to stay in the league. </p>
   <p>	Hargreaves also states that &ldquo;The relationship between the man and the woman was viewed as a reciprocal one in that the woman&#146;s dependent role as wife, housekeeper, and child bearer, which confined her to &#145;the inferior world of the familyâ€¦ left the bourgeois man free to accumulate capital&#146; in order to maintain her adequately.&rdquo; &nbsp;I feel like this was shown at the end of the movie when Dottie&#146;s husband returns home from war and she immediately packed up to return home. &nbsp;What she was doing at the time was not nearly as important as being a housewife for her husband. &nbsp;</p>
   <p style="text-indent:36.000000pt">Another part of the movie that was true is the fact that no African American women participated in the league. &nbsp;They didn&#146;t address this much in the movie but there was a brief clip of a foul ball landing near some African American&#146;s in the crowd. &nbsp;One of the girls picked up the ball and through it back in extremely hard and everyone looked impressed. &nbsp;It wasn&#146;t talked about but it was easy to tell they were not allowed to play. &nbsp;In the article by Rader, it states, &ldquo;that the league recruited no black players reflected not only the racism of the day but the prevailing white stereotypes of female beauty as well.&rdquo;</p>
   <p>	Rader also states &ldquo;while industrial basketball exploited the sexual attractions of women and the dominance of male coaches limited the chances for women professionals in these fields, the female athletes themselves rarely objected.&rdquo; &nbsp;This was very prevalent throughout the movie, being forced to wear short dresses and being coached by males. &nbsp;The players were even asked to make a good pose while playing the game for the photographers to capture a picture. &nbsp;While originally opposed to the idea, Dottie eventually noticed that the reporters were losing interest, so on a foul bowl hit behind home plate; she did the splits as she caught the ball. This grabbed the attention of everyone and appeared to completely change the way people thought of them playing baseball. </p>
   <p>	&nbsp;It was quite an accomplishment of what the players of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League where able to do. &nbsp;Being able to play a male&#146;s sport and attract fans to the games with their amount of success just hasn&#146;t really been seen since then. &nbsp;They faced many challenges along the way, had to adhere to strict rules that would never be forced on men, and still had to play the sport at a high level. &nbsp;I think it was great for the advancement of women in sports as well as just a great opportunity for those athletes that participated. &nbsp;If there were a similar situation today, women from all over the world would be jumping at the opportunity. &nbsp;</p>
