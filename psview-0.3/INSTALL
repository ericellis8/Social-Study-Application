INSTALLING THE VIEWER

Prerequisite software:
- Apache/PHP
- MySQL
- wv (for viewing word documents)
- ImageMagick (image conversion)
- Ghostscript (for postscript and pdf)
- Wget

Directory layout
In operation, the viewer uses the following directory structure:
- bin/      shell scripts for document conversion
- html/     web pages
- html/rsc/ fetched and converted documents, needs to be writable for apache  
- inc/      php include files

To install the viewer software, perform the following steps:
0: Install prerequisite software.

1: Point apache at the html directory and allow php to include files from the inc directory. An example virtual host configuration can be found in the example.httpd.conf file included in this package. Restart apache.

2: Create a mysql database for the viewer to use, and feed it the file
   - db/psview.sql

3: Edit database and path information in the files
   - inc/db.inc (database connection info)
   - inc/const.inc (path to directories and binaries)
   - bin/render.sh (path to wv, ghostscript and convert)

4: Run the viewer (browse index.html) and fix any problems that crop up, such as missing or wrong path's and url's :-)
