This is version 0.3 of psview, the Online viewer for PDF, PostScript and Word which can be found at http://view.samurajdata.se/

psview is open source software, released under the GPL.

The INSTALL file contains installation instructions.

Known problems:
- Creating the MySQL tables may balk because of 'Position' being a reserved word in newer versions of MySQL. Will fix in later releases.

Original author:
- Claes Månsson, cj@samurajdata.se
